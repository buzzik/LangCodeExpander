# LocalesNames
Node.js app locales handler. Generates names, native names and flags from locales list.
Uses input.txt as input. It should contain list of locales in "en-US" format
As a result you will get an html <li> list in the /result/ directory.
The list will contain locale, locale name, locale native name, country flag for this locale. Template can be edited in code(for csv export, for example)
For country flags thanks to https://github.com/hampusborgos/country-flags
